# Electronic-Voting-System
This repository contains an Electronic Voting System built using the C programming language.The project demonstrates how a simple digital voting process can be simulated in a console environment using fundamental C concepts such as structures, arrays, functions,and file handling.It is designed for learning,and showcasing basic system design skills.
What this project does

Shows a list of candidates

Allows the user to select a candidate and vote

Counts the votes

Displays the final result

Shows which candidate won

Why I made this

I made this project to practice basic C programming and understand how simple digital voting works.


---

C concepts used

printf and scanf

if-else statements

switch statements

loops (for, while)

arrays (for storing votes)

How to run

1. Open the file in any C compiler (VS Code, CodeBlocks, Turbo C, etc.)


2. Compile the program


3. Run it and follow the instructions on the screen
4.Goal of the project

To learn how simple systems like voting machines can be created using basic C language.
